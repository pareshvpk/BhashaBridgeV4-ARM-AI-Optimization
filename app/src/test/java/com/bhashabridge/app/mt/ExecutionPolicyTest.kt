/**
 * Locks two rules.
 *
 * The first is what ORT enforces on `session.intra_op_thread_affinities`: the number of `;`-separated
 * groups must equal `intraThreads - 1` (ORT never pins the calling thread). A wrong count throws at
 * session creation, so it is worth a pure-JVM guard rather than only an on-device catch.
 *
 * The second is the thread rule itself. It is a one-line expression that decides a shipping default
 * for every device, and its upper bound has already been wrong once — the old cap of 4 sent the
 * SM-S948B's eight uniform Oryon cores to 4 threads, measured as a regression against 2. Pinning the
 * derivation here means changing that bound cannot happen silently.
