/**
 * Production-path thread + execution-mode A/B — the evidence for queue item Q2b.
 *
 * [MtTuningSweepTest] answers the same question on the *non-production* load path: it leaves
 * `optCache` off so it can vary `optLevel`, so every config there loads the source `.onnx` under
 * ALL_OPT. Production loads a baked `.ort` under NO_OPT with mmap, and `OnnxModels.loadOptions()`
 * builds those options from `tune.toOptions()` — so `intraThreads`, `interThreads`, the execution
 * mode, `cpuArena` and affinity all still apply, but the surrounding graph and allocator behaviour
 * differ. This test therefore keeps `ExecutionPolicy.current` intact (cache on) and varies one knob
 * at a time on top of it.
 *
 * **`SHIPPING` is `ExecutionPolicy.current` unmodified**, and it runs in both suites. Until now no
 * arm here was the shipping configuration — every arm set `intraOpAffinities = null` while production
 * ships intra=2 *with* one pinned worker — so the sweep could not say anything about what users run.
 * Keeping it in both suites also gives the two invocations a common control: if `SHIPPING` disagrees
 * between them, they were taken under different thermal conditions and must not be joined.
 *
 * **Drift handling differs from [MtTuningSweepTest] deliberately.** That test runs each config as one
 * contiguous block, so a config's position in the list contaminates its result — on the SM-S948B the
 * baseline bookends showed +13.4% drift across a 97 s run, roughly +1.2% per position, which is the
 * same order as the effect being measured. Here every config is measured in every round, with the
 * order rotated each round, so position averages out instead of accumulating. Report the median of
 * the pooled samples, and read the `DRIFT` line before believing any between-arm delta.
 *
 * Asserts correctness only — output *and* generated token count identical across arms. Latency is
 * logged, never asserted: a benchmark must not fail on thermal noise.
 *
 * Drive it (two invocations, cool down between; `-e rounds 1 -e runs 2` is a ~70 s smoke run that
 * proves every arm can build a session before committing to the real thing):
 * ```
 * adb shell am instrument -w -e class com.bhashabridge.app.mt.ProductionThreadSweepTest#sweepThreadCounts \
