/**
 * Queue item Q15: is file-backed actually the better kind of memory here?
 *
 * §3.27 moved 451 MB of weights from anonymous heap to file-backed mappings and left the decision
 * open, because the argument for it — "clean pages can be dropped, anonymous pages can only be
 * swapped or killed for" — was reasoning, not measurement. On this device it is also **partly
 * wrong**: the M31 has 6 GB of zram (5.1 GB free), so anonymous pages are not unswappable. They are
 * compressed. The real comparison is therefore *drop-and-re-read from flash* against
 * *compress-and-decompress in zram*, and which one costs more when the pages are needed again.
 *
 * The test applies real pressure — touched direct allocations, in 128 MB steps — and watches, per
 * step: how much of the model mapping is still resident, what the system has left, how much has
 * gone to swap, and what a translation costs at that moment.
 *
 * Each arm runs in its own process (one `am instrument` invocation per test method), because the
 * whole point is to let the kernel reclaim from a process holding one arm's memory layout.
 *
 * Logged under `BB.Q15`.

     *
     * **It is not the file-backed arm either, which §3.50 had to measure to discover.** ORT maps

     *  - A **private mapping of `/dev/zero`** — `FileChannel.map` refuses it with `IOException`; it
     *    is a character device with no length to map.
     *
