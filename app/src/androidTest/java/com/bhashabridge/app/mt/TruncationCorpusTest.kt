/**
 * The corpus measurement behind queue item Q0: how often did the length cap actually truncate?
 *
 * `targetCap` was `max(14, sourceLen)` — a target could never exceed its source token count — and
 * that was argued to truncate real sentences rather than measured to. This runs a spread of
 * sentence lengths through the real engine and reports, per sentence, the source token count, the
 * generated token count, and both caps: the one that shipped and the one that replaced it.
 *
 * A sentence is counted as **truncated under the old rule** when its generated length reached that
 * rule's cap — i.e. the translation the user sees today would have stopped mid-sentence.
 *
 * Generated length is counted by decoding to EOS through the same stage-level path `MtWorkload`
 * uses, not by re-encoding the output (re-encoding Hindi with the English vocabulary misses every
 * word and inflates the count — a trap this project has already fallen into once).
 *
 * Results are logged under `BB.Corpus`. Drive with:
 * `adb shell am instrument -w -e class com.bhashabridge.app.mt.TruncationCorpusTest \
 *   com.bhashabridge.app.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`
