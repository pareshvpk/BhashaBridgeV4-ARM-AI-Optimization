/**
 * Does the speech path leak when it is used the way a user uses it — over and over?
 *
 * Every existing speech test runs one session. One session cannot fail this way: a `Recognizer`, an
 * `AudioRecord`, three audio effects, a `MediaCodec` and a `MediaExtractor` that are each acquired
 * and released once look identical whether or not the release actually worked. Only repetition
 * separates them, which is why the resource-lifecycle audit could close every hole it found by
 * reading and still not know the answer.
 *
 * **File descriptors are the sharp instrument here, not memory.** `AudioRecord`, each audio effect,
 * the codec and the extractor all hold kernel objects with an fd apiece; a missed release shows up as
 * a straight line in `/proc/self/fd` with no allocator, no GC and no page cache to blur it. Native
 * heap is reported too, but asserted loosely — jemalloc returns pages to the OS lazily and on its own
 * schedule (§3.25 measured exactly that), so a tight bound there would fail honestly-clean runs.
 *
 * The model is loaded once and shared by every cycle, matching production: `BhashaBridgeApp` owns it
 * at process scope. A test that reloaded it per cycle would be measuring the model loader.
