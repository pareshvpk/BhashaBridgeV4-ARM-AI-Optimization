/**
 * The scoring harness for Q8 — every recogniser tuning decision is made against these numbers.
 *
 * [SpeechPipelineBenchmarkTest] measures the pipeline once, end to end, which is the right shape for
 * a validation report and the wrong one for tuning: a single sample of Vosk plus MediaCodec plus the
 * translator cannot tell you whether a knob moved the recogniser or the weather. This test isolates
 * Vosk, repeats it, and reports a realtime factor per arm.
 *
 * Two sweeps, answering different questions. [sweepsRecogniserConfigurations] varies how the audio
 * is *fed* to the English model — sample rate and buffer size — and found nothing (§3.33).
 * [sweepsHindiDecodeConfiguration] varies how hard the Hindi model *searches*, under noise, and
 * found the one real defect (§3.34).
 *
 * **Feed arms.** Each is one `Recognizer` configuration fed the same utterance:
 *  - `16k` — production today: capture at 16 kHz, `Recognizer(model, 16000f)`.
 *  - `8k`  — the same audio downsampled to 8 kHz with `Recognizer(model, 8000f)`.
 *  - `chunk_*` — the production rate at other buffer sizes.
 *
 * The `8k` arm exists because `assets/model/conf/mfcc.conf` reads `--sample-frequency=8000`
 * `--high-freq=3700`: the English model is a telephone-band model, so **every sample above 3.7 kHz
 * that the microphone captures is discarded inside Kaldi**, after this app has paid to record, copy
 * and RMS it, and after Kaldi has paid to resample it away. The arm measures what that costs.
 *
 * **The downsample is deliberately outside the timed region, and that is the point of the
 * comparison, not a flaw in it.** In production nothing in this app would do that work: the
 * microphone path would ask `AudioRecord` for 8 kHz and the platform's own resampler — which is
 * running anyway, because the hardware captures at 48 kHz regardless — would deliver it. So the
 * timed region is the honest one: what the app would actually still be paying for.
 *
 * Accuracy is guarded, not measured. The fixtures are synthesised speech, so a word-error rate over
 * them would describe one synthetic voice; what matters for a tuning decision is whether an arm
 * *changed* what was heard. The feed sweep asserts it did not ([assertSameTranscript]) because a
 * different sample rate has no business altering the answer; the decode sweep only reports it,
 * because a narrower beam is allowed to — that trade is a product decision, not one a benchmark
 * fails a build over.

     * Q8a: what the Hindi model's decode width costs, and whether narrowing it changes what is heard.
     *
     * Hindi used to ship the wide configuration (`--max-active=7000 --beam=13.0 --lattice-beam=4.0`)
     * over an FST graph 2.4× larger than English's (55.9 MB against 34.4 MB), and had never been
     * timed. This sweep is what found that it ran **1.91× realtime at 10 dB SNR** — losing to live
     * speech — and §3.34 narrowed it to English's values on the strength of these numbers.
     *
     * It stays as the regression guard, so run it on any new device. The interesting output now is
     * that `hi_wide_7000` is still slow and still heard the same thing.
     *
     * `max-active`, `beam` and `lattice-beam` are read out of `conf/model.conf` when the `Model` is
     * constructed, and [VoskModels] unpacks that file to `filesDir`. So the sweep rewrites the
     * unpacked copy and rebuilds the model per arm — the only way to vary these without shipping a
     * second copy of a 56 MB graph. **The original text is restored in a `finally`**: this file
     * belongs to the installed app, and leaving an arm's configuration behind would silently retune
     * the real thing.
