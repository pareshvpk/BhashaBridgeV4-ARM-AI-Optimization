/**
 * Purpose:  Loads and holds the Vosk acoustic model for each [Direction]'s *source* language.
 * Owns:     One native [Model] per direction, loaded on first use.
 * Lifetime: Process — constructed and [release]d by [com.bhashabridge.app.BhashaBridgeApp].
 * Thread:   [model] blocks (asset unpack + native load); call it off the main thread. Synchronised
 *           so the audio thread and the UI-triggered warm-up cannot race.
 *
 * The model is keyed by [Direction], not by a language string, so "which recogniser" can never
 * drift out of step with "which translation direction" — LESSONS_FROM_V3 L11, where v3.4.1's
 * audio-file import kept transcribing with the English model in HI→EN mode because nothing tied
 * the two together.
 *
 * A `Recognizer` is deliberately *not* held here. It is bound to one model for its whole life, so
 * v3.4.1 had to rebuild it on every swap and got it wrong when a swap raced a load. Here each
 * recording session builds its own from the model it is about to use — cheap, and impossible to
 * point at the wrong language.
