/**
 * Purpose:  Unpacks an asset folder to app-private storage and returns its path.
 * Owns:     Nothing.
 * Lifetime: Process
 * Thread:   Blocking file I/O — never call from the main thread.
 *
 * Vosk loads a model from a real directory path; it cannot read an APK asset stream. Idempotent:
 * once the destination exists and is non-empty the multi-hundred-file copy is skipped, so the cost
 * is paid once per install.
 */

    /**
     * The unpack is staged and renamed rather than written in place. "Destination exists and is
     * non-empty" was the only completeness test available, and a copy interrupted after its first
     * file satisfies it permanently: Vosk would then load a model directory missing most of its
     * files, on every launch, with no way back short of clearing app data.
     *
     * It is also not a *freshness* test, which is the second half of the same problem. `filesDir`
     * survives app updates, so once a model has been unpacked the app never looks at that asset
     * again — ship a retuned `conf/model.conf` and every existing install keeps decoding with the
     * old one, silently, forever. That is not hypothetical: it is exactly how the Hindi decode-width
     * change would have failed to reach anybody who already had the app.
     *
     * So the published directory carries a [stamp] beside it, and a mismatch re-unpacks.
