/**
 * Purpose:  Translates one direction's text end-to-end: tokenize → encode → decode → detokenize.
 *           The single type the rest of the app calls for machine translation; nothing above it
 *           touches ONNX Runtime, a tokenizer, or a [Decoder].
 * Owns:     One [Tokenizer] (heap) and one [OnnxModels] (native: encoder + decoder_init + decoder_step
 *           sessions). Transient per-step tensors and the per-translation KV cache are created and
 *           closed inside [translate].
 * Lifetime: Constructed and [release]d by [com.bhashabridge.app.BhashaBridgeApp] at process scope.
 * Thread:   [translate] is synchronous; run it off the main thread. Not internally synchronised —
 *           one engine per direction, one translation at a time.
 *
 * The decode strategy is injected as a [Decoder] (default [GreedyDecoder], what v3.4.1 shipped).
 * MtEngine depends only on that interface. Phase 6B moved from the uncached decoder to the verified
 * cached graphs (Phase 6A): the whole change lives in [CachedLogitsSource], behind the frozen
 * [LogitsSource] seam — no decoder code changed. The decoder still just asks "logits for this
 * prefix"; the runtime, not the decoder, owns and advances the cache.

 * The last position's logits row out of a `[1, dec_len, vocab]` output tensor — one row of 122,672

 *
 * This used to be `(tensor.value as Array<Array<FloatArray>>)[0].last().copyOf()`, which copies the
 * data **twice**: `value` materialises the whole output as boxed nested Java arrays, then `copyOf`
 * duplicates the one surviving row. None of it shows up in ORT's operator profiler, which sees kernel
 * time only — it lands in the 21% "outside kernels" bucket entry #9 measured and could not attribute
 * (bench/results/cross-device/S26U_EXPERIMENTS.md §1).
 *
 * **`getFloatBuffer()` is not a zero-copy view** — worth stating, because the name suggests otherwise
 * and the plan for this change assumed it. Disassembling ORT 1.27.0's `OnnxTensor` shows it does
 * `FloatBuffer.allocate(capacity)` then `put(nativeView)`: a full heap copy of the entire tensor.
 * Swapping `value` for it, on its own, buys nothing.
 *
 * What it does buy is the *second* copy, and only because that heap buffer is array-backed. When
 * `dec_len == 1` — every `decoder_step` call, i.e. all but the first token of every translation — the
 * buffer's backing array *is* the row, so [java.nio.FloatBuffer.array] hands it over with nothing
 * further copied: two full-width copies per token become one. `dec_len > 1` (`decoder_init`, once per
 * translation) still needs the slice.
 *
 * The returned array must stay mutable and unshared — [applyRepetitionPenalty] and
 * [blockRepeatedNgrams] write into it in place. Both branches satisfy that: `allocate` produced the
 * backing array fresh inside `getFloatBuffer`, and nothing else holds a reference to it.
 *
 * Batch is assumed to be 1, as it is everywhere in this runtime — one translation at a time, never a
 * batched fan-out. Both branches read `shape[1]`/`shape[2]` only, so a batched tensor would be wrong
 * in either; the assumption belongs to the engine, not to this function.
 *
 * ponytail: the "real lever upstream" this comment used to claim — slicing the last position inside
 * the exported `decoder_init` so it stops returning a row per prefix position — was re-exported and
 * measured, and it is worth nothing here (OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY §3.31). Greedy seeds a one-token
 * prefix and every later token takes `decoder_step`, so `decoder_init` runs once per translation at
 * `dec_len = 1`: there is no discarded row to remove, and the `shape[1] == 1L` fast path below is
 * what the greedy path actually takes. The sliced graph is held for beam (§9 Q6), which is the only
 * caller that hands `decoder_init` a long prefix.
