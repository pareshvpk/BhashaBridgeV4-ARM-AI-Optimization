/**
 * Purpose:  Owns the three KV-cache [OrtSession]s for one [Direction] — encoder, decoder_init,
 *           decoder_step — and the one-time copy of their `.onnx` assets to app-private storage
 *           (ONNX Runtime loads from a file path).
 * Owns:     Three native `OrtSession`s. The [OrtEnvironment] is a process-wide singleton per ONNX
 *           Runtime's contract and is NOT closed here.
 * Lifetime: Created and released by [com.bhashabridge.app.BhashaBridgeApp] at process scope. Nothing
 *           else may construct or release it (R4.4). This is the fix for v3.4.1's L2 leak: one
 *           owner, one [release], a real call site.
 * Thread:   Construction blocks until all three sessions load. `run()` on the exposed sessions is
 *           synchronous on the caller's thread.
 *
 * Phase 6B replaced the single uncached decoder with the verified cached pair from Phase 6A:
 * decoder_init (first step, builds the cache) then decoder_step (later steps, cache in and out).
 * decoder_step has NO `encoder_hidden_states` input — with past present the graph reuses cached
 * cross-attn K/V, so torch.onnx pruned it (see model_pipeline/EXPORT_WITH_CACHE.md). The runtime
 * must feed the cache back each step, never that input.
 *
 * Session options come from [tune] (Phase 7). The default [OrtTuning] leaves every knob at ONNX
 * Runtime's own defaults, i.e. the exact behaviour before Phase 7; the benchmark-selected production
 * config is set as that default once measured (see docs/ORT_TUNING.md). No XNNPACK/NEON/SME here.
 *
 * Phase 11C loads the three sessions **concurrently** (docs/PARALLEL_SESSION_INITIALIZATION.md). The
 * constructor still blocks until all three exist, so every consumer sees the same fully-built object
 * it always did; only the wall-clock cost of building it changed. Nothing about inference, the cache
 * contract, or session ownership moved.
 *
 * Q21 (§3.47) changed **what the cache is**, not how it works: the bake writes optimized ONNX that
 * still points at the one shared weight blob, instead of an ORT flatbuffer that re-inlined those
 * weights into each graph. Same bake-once-load-NO_OPT design, 267 MB on disk instead of 473 MB. The
 * blob is consequently permanent rather than bake scratch — see [purgeWeightPart].
