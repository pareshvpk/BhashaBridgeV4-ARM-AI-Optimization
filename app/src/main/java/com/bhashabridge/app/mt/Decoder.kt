 * Purpose:  The decoding abstraction. Turns a stream of next-token logits into a target token
 *           sequence. This is the ONLY thing MtEngine will depend on for its choice of decode
 *           strategy — greedy or beam is a swap of the [Decoder] instance, nothing else.
 * Owns:     Nothing. A decoder holds no native resources and no per-translation state that outlives
 *           a [decode] call.
 * Thread:   [decode] is synchronous and reentrant; run it on whatever thread MtEngine uses.
 *
 * A decoder knows nothing about ONNX Runtime, tokenizers, encoders, or Android. Its entire view of
 * the model is [LogitsSource]. That is deliberate: when the KV-cache export lands (Phase 5), the
 * source changes from "re-feed the whole prefix" to "feed one token + cached state" and NO decoder
 * code changes. The abstraction is the seam that isolates that rewrite.
