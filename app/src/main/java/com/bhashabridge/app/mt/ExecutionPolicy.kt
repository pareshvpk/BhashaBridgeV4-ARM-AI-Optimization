 * for the SM-M315F, so the same binary configures itself sensibly on any Arm core.

     *
     * - **Threads:** intra-op parallelism = **half the performance cluster**, bounded to [1, 2]. The
     *   work is a sequence of *small* int8 GEMMs (one token at a time), which is latency-bound and
     *   saturates its intra-op parallelism almost immediately. Phase 7 measured this on the 4-big-core
     *   SM-M315F: 2 threads was the sweet spot; 4 added big.LITTLE scheduler sync/migration jitter for
     *   no median gain, and 8 (all cores, onto the efficiency cluster) collapsed.
     *
     *   The upper bound used to be 4, on the reasoning that an 8-big flagship should scale to 4. Entry
     *   #9 measured exactly that case and it does not: on the SM-S948B (8 uniform Oryon cores, so
     *   `perfCores = 8` → 4 threads) the production-path A/B — `optCache` on, NO_OPT, mmap `.ort`, the
     *   real shipping load path, 7 configs × 3 rotated rounds, n=45 each, every arm parity-exact —
     *   put `intra2` at 99 ms against `intra4`'s 104 ms on the long sentence (−4.8%) and 27 ms against
     *   31 ms on the short one (−12.9%), with `intra6`/`intra8` degrading steeply beyond that. See
     *   bench/results/cross-device/S26U_EXPERIMENTS.md §2b.
     *
     *   So the cap is 2: across nine devices spanning Armv8.0 → ARMv9 and four vendors, **no entry has
     *   ever measured 4 threads as the optimum**, and the only device whose topology could derive 4
     *   measured it as a regression. Eight of the nine already derive 1 or 2 from `perfCores / 2`, so
     *   this bound changes behaviour on that one part alone. (inter-op stays sequential: one stream,
     *   not a throughput fan-out.) Re-validate per new topology; the heuristic is the default, not a
     *   proof for cores no entry has measured.
     * - **Memory:** the CPU arena is disabled. Phase 7 measured it as pure overhead for this steady,
     *   one-translation-at-a-time workload (−37% process memory, no latency cost) — a property of the
     *   workload, not the device, so it holds across the Arm ecosystem.
     * - **The graph cache is optimized ONNX over one shared weight blob** (Q21, §3.47), not the ORT
     *   flatbuffer, and not the buffer-mapped initializers that shipped between §3.44 and §3.47 —
     *   `use_ort_model_bytes_for_initializers` is an ORT-format-only trick and does not apply to this
     *   artifact, which ORT maps for itself. §3.46 measured every format through the real engine: load,
     *   first inference and steady-state latency all tie, and this layout is **−193 MB of storage and
     *   −333 MB of PSS** because three ~1 MB graphs share one blob instead of re-inlining the decoder
     *   weights twice. Nothing here is device-dependent, so it is not conditioned on [caps].
     * - **Int8 acceleration is automatic, and Q7 (§3.52) established that it has to be.** ORT's MLAS
     *   kernels dispatch on HWCAP at runtime, so the same int8 graphs use plain NEON on an Armv8.0 core
     *   and SDOT/i8mm/SME on capable cores with no config here. The policy therefore does not toggle
     *   ISA kernels — and the reason is not that the AAR lacks alternatives. It ships CPU, NNAPI and
     *   XNNPACK, and both were measured on the real graphs: **XNNPACK claims zero nodes**, because the
     *   hot GEMMs fuse to `com.microsoft` contrib ops (`DynamicQuantizeMatMul`, `MatMulIntegerToFloat`)
     *   that its EP cannot take — a property of the export, not of the CPU — and **NNAPI is 2.25×
     *   slower**, taking ~5% of nodes while partitioning inflates CPU node executions by 35–40%. So
     *   [caps] informs threads and logging because there is presently nothing else for it to select;
     *   a QDQ re-export is what would change that.
     * - **KleidiAI is disabled on SME parts, which is the one place it is reachable.** Its NEON
     *   `dotprod`/`i8mm` kernels are `qsi4c32p` — 4-bit, and therefore inert for this project's 8-bit
     *   weights — so only its 8-bit `qsi8cxp` SME kernels ever run. Measured on the SM-S948B, three
     *   runs at three temperatures with in-run duplicate controls: those kernels are **10–13% slower**
     *   than MLAS's own at the shipping thread count, and also cost ~10% more CPU and ~35–45 MB of
     *   PSS. On the SM-M315F (no dotprod, no i8mm, no SME) the same A/B is indistinguishable — the
     *   2.1% "effect" was smaller than that run's own 4.0% control spread. See OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY
     *   §3.38–§3.39.
     *
     *   The predicate is `caps.sme` rather than an unconditional `true` deliberately: every non-SME
     *   device then keeps byte-identical behaviour by construction, instead of relying on the M31
     *   result generalising to parts that have i8mm but no SME, which no run has measured.
     *
     *   This **reverses §3.20's direction**, which priced KleidiAI at 4–9% the other way from two runs
     *   it described as thermally degraded. SME still executes — `simpleperf` finds
     *   `kai_..._sme_mopa` hottest — this says those kernels are slower, not absent.
