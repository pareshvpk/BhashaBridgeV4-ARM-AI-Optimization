/**
 * Purpose:  Orchestrates the translation screen — direction, engine warm-up, every translation,
 *           and the speech session. The single place that decides *what* to translate and *when*.
 * Owns:     The MT dispatcher, the [AudioCapture] session, and the [Tts] engine. Not the models:
 *           MT engines and Vosk models are borrowed from [BhashaBridgeApp] at process scope and
 *           never released here (R4.3/R4.4).
 * Lifetime: ViewModel — survives configuration change, so a rotation mid-translation neither
 *           restarts the job nor reloads a model.
 * Thread:   Public API is main-thread. MT calls run on [mt]; capture runs on IO inside its flow.
 *
 * This is the class that stops [MainActivity] from becoming v3.4.1's 961-line Activity. The
 * Activity renders [state] and forwards taps; it has no reference to an engine, a recogniser or a
 * decoder, and cannot acquire one.
