/**
 * Purpose:  Process entry point, and the sole owner of every native resource in the app.
 * Owns:     One [MtEngine] per [Direction] and the [VoskModels], all created lazily.
 * Lifetime: Process
 * Thread:   Main; [translator] is synchronised so a background translate thread can create engines.
 *
 * This class is the answer to LESSONS_FROM_V3.md L2. In V3.4.1 the chain was
 * `Activity -> Translator -> OnnxSessionManager -> OrtSession`, with a creator at every level and
 * a destroyer at none: `OnnxSessionManager.release()` was correct code with zero call sites, so
 * every rotation leaked ~639 MB of native heap and re-paid an 8.6-second model load.
 *
 * The fix is structural, not vigilance. Native resources are owned here, at process scope, so an
 * Activity being destroyed cannot orphan them and a rotation cannot trigger a reload. Activities
 * and ViewModels borrow via [translator]; they never construct or release an [MtEngine] (R4.3/R4.4).
 * [onTrimMemory] is the single release trigger (R5.4) — at a ~639 MB footprint, returning memory
 * when the OS asks is not optional.

     * parked the UI thread on a ten-second lock. That is an ANR, not a stall.
     *
     * So the borrow counter — read and written constantly, held for nanoseconds — gets its own
     * monitor, and the engine map keeps the slow one.
